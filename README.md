# Tic-tac-toe Bots

Ambition:

* First implement Haskell brute force bot using [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)
* Then implement bots using machine learning. First basic models then using neural networks. Can be trained on randomized games, or games played by the Minimax bot.
* Train the models by having them play against themselves.

Future ideas:
* Do the same for "Four-in-a-row"
* Make a chess bot
